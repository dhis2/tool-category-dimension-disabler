"""An independent second count of the favorites per sharing class.

The app's own SQL view produces `favorites`, `public_favorites`,
`shared_favorites` and `private_favorites` in one pass, all from one SQL
`CASE`. Comparing the table with that same payload would only prove the app
rendered what it was given, and restating the same `CASE` here would only
prove it was copied correctly — neither can catch a misclassification.

So the two halves are split across two layers:

- **which favorites use the dimension** comes from a throwaway SQL view that
  returns nothing but `(favorite uid, favorite kind)` pairs, reached through
  the join tables. No sharing logic at all, and therefore no `CASE` to
  restate;
- **how each of those favorites is shared** comes from the Web API
  (`/api/visualizations`, `/api/maps`, `/api/eventVisualizations`) and is
  classified in Python, from the JSON the server itself reports.

Reading that sharing needs an account that can see every favorite: a private
favorite owned by somebody else is a 404 for a demo `admin` without `ALL`,
and guessing "unreadable means private" would quietly turn a *shared*
favorite into a private one — exactly the class this oracle exists to check.
So the sharing lookups take their own client (`E2E_SUPERUSER`), and the
oracle raises `UnreadableFavorites` rather than guess.

The schema knowledge below is deliberately spelled out rather than derived
from `src/`: an oracle built from the code under test proves nothing.
Verified against 2.40.12 and 2.43.1 (see `docs/schema-check.md`).
