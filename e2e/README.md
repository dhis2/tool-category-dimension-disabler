# End-to-end suite

Drives the **installed** Data Dimension Disabler app in a real browser against
a real DHIS2 instance, and cross-checks every UI claim against the Web API.
One run covers the full life cycle of the app's SQL view: create → read →
filter/sort → disable a dimension of each type → remove → detect and update a
legacy view → permission errors — and leaves the instance as it found it
(view installed, every dimension re-enabled, throwaway user deleted).

The suite is parameterised by environment variables only; no host, UID or
credential is hard-coded, so the same run works on any version from 2.40 up.

## Requirements

- Python 3 with Playwright and a Chromium build (`pip install playwright`,
  `playwright install chromium`).
- The app installed on the target instance:

    ```
    yarn build
    curl -u "$DHIS2_USER:$DHIS2_PASS" -F "file=@build/bundle/data-dimension-disabler-1.0.0.zip" \
        "$DHIS2_URL/api/apps"      # 204 on <= 2.41, 201 on 2.42+
    ```

## Running

```bash
DHIS2_URL=http://dhis2-example:8080 python3 e2e/run_suite.py
```

`E2E_SUPERUSER` is needed on the DHIS2 demo databases: their `admin` has
neither `ALL` nor the generated `M_<app>` authority, so it cannot grant a role
containing them (`E3003`) and the limited-user flow is skipped/fails without
it. The same account also reads the favorites' sharing for the favorite-count
oracle — a private favorite owned by somebody else is a 404 for that `admin`,
and without it those cross-checks report SKIP. Broker instances ship
`local_admin` / `district`, which has `ALL`:

```bash
DHIS2_URL=http://dhis2-example:8080 \
E2E_SUPERUSER=local_admin E2E_SUPERPASS=district \
python3 e2e/run_suite.py
```

The runner exits non-zero if any step fails, prints one line per step, and
writes the same table to `results-<label>.md` next to the screenshots.

| Id                 | What it proves                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `load-missing`     | Fresh load with no view shows the create notice; exactly one header bar (top level ≤2.41, global-shell iframe 2.42+)                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `create-view`      | Create installs the view with the expected name and `r-r-----` sharing; the table lists all four dimension types; every row matches the `/sqlViews/{id}/data` payload; the favorite counts of the three dimensions with the most favorites match an independent second count; records the data endpoint's response time |
| `columns-chooser`  | The table opens with the default columns; the Columns chooser shows "Private", the choice survives a page reload (`localStorage`), and unticking removes it again                                                                                                                                                       |
| `layout`           | The DHIS2 design tokens the stylesheets use resolve in the browser (the app must render `<CssVariables>`); every right-aligned numeric header sits above its numbers; the chooser draws one checkbox per column, ticked for exactly the columns on screen                                                               |
| `filter-sort`      | Each type filter shows exactly that type's rows; name and views sort, both directions (numeric columns start descending)                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `disable-per-type` | Disables the least-viewed object of each type: dialog names object and type, the row disappears, a success alert names it, and the API reports `dataDimension=false`                                                                                                                                                    |

| `data-error`       | With data read removed from the view's sharing, `/data` answers 409 E4312: the app shows the server message, keeps "Remove SQL view" available, and Retry recovers                                                                                                                                                      |
| `outdated-update`  | A legacy category-only view (old name, `rwrw----`) is detected as outdated and updated in place: same UID, new name, `r-r-----`                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `limited-user`     | A user without the SQL view authority sees the server's message plus the "Add/Update SQL view" hint, and the app does not crash                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Platform noise that is not the app's doing (the PWA "not a secure context"
message on plain http, the shell's optional `staticContent/logo_banner` and
`dataStore/custom-translations` 404s, and the expected 404 while the view is
missing) is filtered in `app_driver.BENIGN_CONSOLE` / `BENIGN_HTTP_404`.

## How the table is read

`app_driver.table_rows` reads the header cells
(`[data-test^='usage-header-']`), takes each column's key from the
`data-test` suffix, and zips those keys with the row's `<td>` texts. Rows
therefore come back as dicts keyed by column key (`type`, `name`, `uid`,
`favorites`, `views`, …) covering whatever the column chooser currently
shows — no fixed cell positions — and the trailing action cell, which has no
header of its own, drops out of the zip. `app_driver.set_columns` ticks or
unticks columns through the chooser (ticking an item deliberately leaves the
flyout open, and its backdrop then covers the toggle button, so the menu is
closed by clicking the backdrop, exactly as a user would).

## The favorite-count oracle

`favorite_counts_sql.py` counts one dimension's favorites per sharing class
without reusing any of the app's logic, by splitting the job across two
layers:

- **which favorites use the dimension** comes from a throwaway SQL view —
  created, read and deleted in one call — whose query returns nothing but
  `(favorite uid, favorite kind)` pairs reached through the join tables. Its
  schema knowledge is spelled out in the module rather than imported from
  `src/`, and it contains no sharing logic at all;
- **how each favorite is shared** comes from the Web API
  (`/api/visualizations`, `/api/maps`, `/api/eventVisualizations`,
  `fields=id,sharing`, one filtered request per kind) and is classified in
  Python by `sharing_class()`: public when `sharing.public` starts with `r`;
  shared when it is not public and `sharing.users` or `sharing.userGroups` is
  a non-empty object; private otherwise (`None`, a missing key and `{}` all
  mean "not shared").

Restating the app's own SQL `CASE` here would only have proved it was copied
correctly, so the classification deliberately comes from a different layer
than the view under test. The `CASE` itself was compared against the same
Python rule over every favorite on the test database — 433 rows, 0
disagreements, including the 4 genuinely shared visualizations — and that
check is recorded in `docs/schema-check.md`.

The sharing lookups run as `E2E_SUPERUSER` when it is set. A private favorite
owned by someone else is a 404 for a demo `admin`, and treating "unreadable"
as "private" would silently turn a _shared_ favorite into a private one, so
the oracle raises `UnreadableFavorites` instead and the flow reports SKIP.

One trap worth knowing when writing SQL for a view: DHIS2 refuses to execute
a SQL view whose _text_ contains the word `users` (`E4310`, "SQL query
contains references to protected tables"). The check is a plain word scan, so
even a JSON key in a string literal trips it — `src/sql/buildQuery.ts`
therefore spells that key `('user'||'s')`.

## Known test-oracle gaps

Two findings from `docs/review-2026-09-21/REVIEW-FINDINGS.md` are gaps in
this suite's own oracles, not app defects:

- **L9.** `e2e/flows.py`'s `restore-view` step assumes a notice box is
  always present — test-suite-only, not an app defect. `flow_restore_view`
  (`e2e/flows.py`) calls `ui.notice_title(frame)`, which waits for
  `NOTICE_BOX` to become visible, then only acts if its text contains
  `MISSING_NOTICE`. In the normal full run this works because the preceding
  `limited-user` step (`_ensure_limited_user` / `flow_limited_user`) always
  deletes the SQL view before returning, so `restore-view` reliably finds
  the MISSING notice and recreates the view. When `limited-user` is
  excluded from `E2E_FLOWS` and the preceding `outdated-update` step
  already leaves the view installed and `READY`, `restore-view` opens the
  app straight to the usage table — no notice box ever appears — and
  `notice_title()` times out, raising an exception that is reported as a
  suite FAIL. Fix (test suite, not app code): have `flow_restore_view`
  check whether the table is already rendered before waiting for a notice
  box, e.g. `if frame.locator(ui.USAGE_TABLE).count() > 0: return PASS`
  short-circuit, or document that `limited-user` must run whenever
  `restore-view` does.
- **L10.** `e2e/flows.py`'s name-sort assertion is not locale-aware, unlike
  the app it is testing — test-suite-only, not an app defect.
  `_sort_checks` (`e2e/flows.py:240-251`) computes the expected
  ascending/descending order with Python's `sorted(names, key=str.lower)`,
  i.e. plain code-point comparison after lowercasing. The app itself sorts
  with `a.localeCompare(b, undefined, { sensitivity: 'base' })`
  (`src/components/usageTableUtils.ts:10`), which is correct — ICU
  collation, not naive code-point order, is the right choice for a name
  column. The two orderings usually agree, but seeds with names built from
  `<`, `(`, `,`, and digits expose the gap (verified directly in Node, the
  same V8/ICU engine Chromium uses: `"Age(<1 Yr, 50+Yrs)".localeCompare(
"Age(0-4Yrs,25-49Yrs,50+Yrs)", undefined, {sensitivity: "base"})` returns
  `-1`, i.e. the app's displayed order is the _correct_ `localeCompare`
  order; the suite's Python comparator is simply the wrong oracle for that
  data). Fix (test suite, not app code): reimplement the expected order
  with the same comparator the app uses — either compare through a
  headless JS `localeCompare` call (e.g. via `page.evaluate`) instead of
  Python's `sorted`, or drop the strict-order assertion in favour of a
  weaker check (e.g. "every adjacent pair compares as ≤ under the same rule
  the row values were shown in").
