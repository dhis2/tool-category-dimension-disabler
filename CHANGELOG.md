# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-21

### Changed

- Rewritten on the DHIS2 App Platform (React, TypeScript, @dhis2/ui).
  Replaces the webpack build, jQuery/DataTables and the conditional legacy
  header bar.
- Renamed to **Data Dimension Disabler** (app key `data-dimension-disabler`).
  Uninstall the old "Category dimension disabler" after installing this one.
- The SQL view keeps its UID and is renamed "Data dimension usage"; an old
  install is detected and updated in place from the app. Sharing tightened
  to public read-only (`r-r-----`: metadata read plus data read, since the
  view's data endpoint requires data read).
- Map views are now counted correctly, through the `mapmapviews` join table
  (the view previously joined the map view UID instead of the map UID that
  view events are recorded against).
- Event types counted: VISUALIZATION_VIEW, MAP_VIEW, EVENT_VISUALIZATION_VIEW,
  EVENT_CHART_VIEW, EVENT_REPORT_VIEW.
- The app no longer renders a title of its own — the DHIS2 header bar already
  names it — and the introduction is shorter and runs the full width of the
  page, with tighter spacing above the table.

### Added

- Organisation unit group sets, data element group sets and category option
  group sets, in addition to categories. Data element group set dimensions
  are ranked from visualizations only, since no map view or event
  visualization join table exists for them.
- Type filter, sortable columns, confirmation dialogs, in-app error messages.
- Favorite counts per dimension: how many visualizations, maps and event
  visualizations use it, split into public, shared and private by each
  favorite's sharing.
- A **Columns** chooser above the table. Type and Name are always shown; the
  choice is remembered per browser in `localStorage`
  (`data-dimension-disabler.columns`).
- An ⓘ tooltip in every numeric column header explaining what it counts.
- Support for DHIS2 2.40 to 2.43.

### Fixed

- The app now renders `<CssVariables>`. The app-platform shell does not
  provide the DHIS2 design tokens, so every `var(--spacers-*)` and
  `var(--colors-*)` declaration in the app's own stylesheets was dropped and
  the page rendered with no padding, margins or spacing at all.
- The **Columns** chooser draws a checkbox per entry. `MenuItem`'s `checkbox`
  prop only sets `role` and `aria-checked`, so the current selection was
  invisible behind the open dropdown.
- Numeric column headers are right-aligned above their numbers.
  `DataTableColumnHeader` applies its `align` prop as `text-align` only, which
  cannot move the label inside its flex row, so the header sat 89px to the
  left of the figures it named.
