        <h2>Categories which are enabled as data dimensions but not used in any favorites</h2>
        <p>The table below shows a ranking of categories which are used as dimensions. Categories 
            can be used in the data visualization tools to aggregate data. They are particularly
            useful to generate subtotals along a category. For instance, if you have a category combination
             called "Age/Sex" which consists of two categories, you can easily generate the subtotals for
            the for the category options in Age (e.g. Male and Female) and Age (&lt;15 and &gt;15).</p>
        <p>It is worth considering though whether certain categories should be enabled as a data dimension. For each category
            which is enabled as a data dimension, a column will be created in the analytics tables. This can lead to a large number
            of columns in the analytics tables which can slow down the analytics generation process. It is therefore recommended to
            only enable categories as data dimensions which are actually used in the data visualizations or perhaps data set reports.</p>
        </p>
        <p>The table below shows the relative usage of category dimensions in viewed favorites over the last 12 months. The overall
            count is provided, as well as the contribution to the total count of all category dimensions. The second percentage
            shows how frequently this dimension is used compared to all favorites, regardless of whether they use category dimensions or not.
        </p>
        <p>You should carefully consider which of the dimensions are required. Category dimensions are easily reenabled if needed.
            By disabling categories which are not needed you may be able to reduce the time required to generate analytics tables.
            The user interface of the visualization tools may also be less cluttered if only the necessary dimensions are enabled.
